# Examples Directory

This directory contains example implementations and future feature prototypes that are not currently integrated into the main proxy server but can serve as reference or starting points for extending functionality.

## Directory Structure

### `middleware/`
Example middleware implementations for extending proxy functionality:
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting middleware  
- Custom logging middleware

### `upstream/`
Example upstream server management components:
- Upstream HTTP/HTTPS client with TLS support
- Connection pooling framework
- Health checking system

## Usage

These examples are provided for:
- **Reference**: Understanding how to implement specific features
- **Extension**: Starting point for adding new functionality
- **Learning**: Patterns for building proxy server components

## Integration

The examples are intentionally kept separate from the main codebase to:
- Keep the core proxy focused and clean
- Avoid unused code in production builds
- Provide clear boundaries between core and optional features
- Allow for easy experimentation

When features are needed in production, they can be properly integrated into the main codebase with appropriate tests and documentation.

## Contributing

When adding new examples:
1. Create appropriate directory structure
2. Include clear README documentation
3. Provide usage examples
4. Mark integration status clearly
5. Include any dependencies or requirements
