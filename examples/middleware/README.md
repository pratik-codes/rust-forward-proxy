# Middleware Examples

This directory contains example middleware implementations that can be used as reference for extending the proxy server functionality.

## Available Middleware

### Authentication Middleware (`auth.rs`)
- Basic Bearer token authentication
- Can be extended for more complex auth schemes
- Example usage for protecting proxy access

### Rate Limiting Middleware (`rate_limit.rs`)
- Simple in-memory rate limiting based on client ID
- Configurable request limits and time windows
- Can be extended with Redis backend for distributed systems

### Logging Middleware (`logging.rs`)
- Additional request/response logging functionality
- Can complement the built-in logging system
- Example of how to add custom logging behavior

## Integration Notes

These middleware components are examples and are not currently integrated into the main proxy server. To use them:

1. Import the desired middleware into your proxy server implementation
2. Integrate them into the request handling pipeline
3. Configure them according to your needs

## Future Development

These examples can serve as a foundation for:
- Production-ready middleware system
- Plugin architecture
- Extensible proxy functionality
- Custom request/response processing

The middleware system can be integrated into the main proxy server when the need arises and proper integration patterns are established.
