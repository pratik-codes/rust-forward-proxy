# Upstream Examples

This directory contains example upstream server management implementations that can be used as reference for extending the proxy server with advanced upstream features.

## Available Examples

### Upstream Client (`client.rs`)
- HTTP/HTTPS client with TLS support
- Configurable timeouts
- Certificate verification options
- Example of how to create specialized upstream clients

### Connection Pool (`connection_pool.rs`)
- Basic connection pooling structure
- **Note**: This is currently a placeholder implementation
- Can be extended for production connection pooling
- Example framework for managing upstream connections

### Health Check (`health_check.rs`)
- Health checking framework for upstream servers
- Example monitoring and failure detection
- Can be extended for production health monitoring

## Integration Notes

These upstream components are examples and are not currently integrated into the main proxy server. The main proxy server currently uses Hyper's built-in client directly.

To use these examples:

1. Review the implementation patterns
2. Extend them for your specific needs
3. Integrate them into the proxy server pipeline
4. Configure them according to your upstream requirements

## Future Development

These examples can serve as a foundation for:
- Production-ready upstream management
- Advanced connection pooling
- Upstream health monitoring
- Load balancing capabilities
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Upstream failover logic

## Current Status

- **client.rs**: Functional but not integrated
- **connection_pool.rs**: Placeholder implementation, needs development
- **health_check.rs**: Basic framework, needs implementation

The upstream management system can be integrated into the main proxy server when advanced upstream features are needed.
